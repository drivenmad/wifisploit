# Introduction #
Welcome to the wifisploit wiki, this section is under construction and will be updated in the future.

### What is wifisploit ? ###
As described on the project page, it is a tool designed to automate wifi pentesting.
### How to install it ? ###
Just download the source ( at the moment nothing is uploaded so you cannot ) and run the Install.sh script. I tried to make it distribution agnostic.
### Who created it ? ###
Currently we are two working on this project, spawn and ubuntrue.
### How to use it ? ###
It is very very user-friendly but I will maybe add some tutorials in the future.
